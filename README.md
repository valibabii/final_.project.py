Transcription and translation take the information in DNA and use it to produce proteins. Transcription uses a strand of DNA as a template to build a molecule called RNA.
During translation, the RNA molecule created in the transcription process delivers information from the DNA to the protein-building machines.

Translation is the process where the information carried in mRNA molecules is used to create proteins. The specific sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA molecule provides the code for the production of a protein with a specific sequence of amino acids.
Much like how RNA is built from many nucleotides, a protein is formed from many amino acids. A chain of amino acids is called a ‘polypeptide chain’ and a polypeptide chain bends and folds on itself to form a protein.

During translation, the information of the strand of RNA is ‘translated’ from RNA language into polypeptide language i.e. the sequence of nucleotides is translated into a sequence of amino acids.

RNA molecules only contain four different types of nitrogenous bases but there are 20 different amino acids that are used to build proteins. In order to turn four into 20, a combination of three nitrogenous bases provides the information for one amino acid. A strand of mRNA obviously has multiple codons which provide the information for multiple amino acids. Start codon starts the protein formation as AUG and Stop codon UAA, UAG, UGA
